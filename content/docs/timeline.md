## üìä Grading Distribution

- **Individual Lab Phases (1-5)**: Each phase will be evaluated based on functionality, code quality, and documentation. Detailed rubric will be published soon.
- **Group Project & Presentation**: Assessment will focus on system design principles, technical implementation, and presentation quality. Detailed evaluation criteria will be shared before Week 10.


## üîç Important Notes

- Each phase builds upon the previous one, creating a complete learning journey
- Evaluations occur regularly to provide feedback and guidance
- Group work begins in Week 10, allowing sufficient time for comprehensive research and implementation
- Final presentations should demonstrate both technical mastery and effective communication
