# 📚 Distributed Systems Lab — Detailed Breakdown

This lab is structured as a step-by-step journey through the lifecycle of building a distributed system with microservices.

---

## 🚀 Phase 1: Monolithic Smart Library System

We begin with a **monolithic design**, where all components of the system reside in a single codebase.

**You’ll Learn:**
- How to structure a monolithic application
- Why monoliths become difficult to scale and maintain
- Building core modules: Users, Catalog, Borrowing
- Separation of concerns: Controller → Service → Repository layers

---

## 🧩 Phase 2: Transition to Microservices

Next, we break down the monolith into independently deployable **microservices**.

**You’ll Learn:**
- How to decompose services by business capability
- RESTful API communication between services
- Managing independent data sources
- Principles of loose coupling and bounded context

---

## 🌐 Phase 3: Reverse Proxy with Nginx

We introduce **Nginx** to centralize and manage access to microservices.

**You’ll Learn:**
- How reverse proxies work
- Nginx configuration for routing and load balancing
- Handling HTTPS and static files with Nginx
- Benefits of centralized access control and logging

---

## 🐳 Phase 4: Containerization with Docker

Now we **containerize** each service to ensure consistency across environments.

**You’ll Learn:**
- Writing Dockerfiles for services
- Managing containers, images, and networks
- Creating isolated environments for each service

---

## ⚙️ Phase 5: Managing with Docker Compose

With more services, orchestration becomes important. Enter **Docker Compose**.

**You’ll Learn:**
- Defining multi-service environments in `docker-compose.yml`
- Networking between services
- Simplifying development and testing

---

## 🚢 Phase 6: Orchestration with Docker Swarm

For real-world scalability, we use **Docker Swarm** to orchestrate services across a cluster.

**You’ll Learn:**
- Setting up a Swarm cluster
- Deploying services in a distributed fashion
- Achieving high availability and self-healing systems

---

## 🧠 Bonus Topics: System Design

Distributed systems are more than code — they’re about design. We’ll embed the following concepts throughout the lab:

- CAP Theorem and trade-offs
- Designing for fault tolerance
- Scaling strategies (horizontal vs vertical)
- Caching and database patterns
- Observability and metrics

---

## 🎓 Final Outcome

By the end of this lab, you will have:

- Built and deployed a functional microservices application
- Practiced containerization and orchestration
- Understood the real-world workflow of backend and DevOps engineering
- Strengthened your system design thinking
