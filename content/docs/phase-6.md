## 🚢 Phase 6: Orchestration with Docker Swarm (Optional)

Once you’ve mastered local development, we introduce **Docker Swarm** for distributed service orchestration.

### 🎯 You’ll Learn:
- Running your app on a multi-node Docker cluster
- Service scaling, rolling updates, and high availability
- Managing load balancing and service discovery

### 🛠 Topics Covered:
- Initializing a Docker Swarm (`docker swarm init`)
- Creating overlay networks
- Deploying stacks via `docker stack deploy`
- Scaling services with replicas
- Monitoring service health and logs

> 🔁 **Optional Lab**: Simulate node failure and observe Swarm's self-healing
