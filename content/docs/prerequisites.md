# 📋 Prerequisites

Before diving into the Smart Library System project, it’s important to ensure that students or participants have the foundational knowledge and hands-on exposure to the following areas:

---

## 🌐 1. Basic Understanding of Web Application & Development

- Understand the **client-server model**.
- Familiarity with how a web application works (browser → server → database).
- Concept of **HTTP verbs**: `GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, `DELETE`, etc.
- Awareness of **RESTful API principles**:
  - Resource-oriented endpoints
  - Stateless communication
  - Uniform interface

---

## 🔧 2. API Development in Any Language

Participants should have prior experience with creating APIs in **any programming language**.

> 💡 **Reference**: Check out the [🛠️ Tools & Technology Stack](/docs/tools.md#-tools--technology-stack) section for supported languages and frameworks (Python, Node.js, Java, C#).

Minimum experience includes:
- Routing & endpoint creation
- Accepting and parsing JSON input
- Sending JSON responses
- Status codes (`200 OK`, `400 Bad Request`, etc.)

---

## 🗃️ 3. Basic Database Understanding

Familiarity with **relational databases** such as PostgreSQL, MySQL, or MSSQL.

Students should know:
- Creating tables and defining schema
- Performing CRUD operations:
  - `SELECT`, `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`
- Concepts like:
  - Primary keys
  - Foreign keys
  - Relationships (one-to-many, many-to-many)

---

## 🔌 4. Database Integration with Backend

Experience connecting an application to a database, such as:
- Using **ORM** (like SQLAlchemy, TypeORM, Hibernate, EF Core)
- Writing raw SQL queries or using query builders
- Handling database migrations (bonus)
- Performing DB transactions inside the application code

---

## 🔍 5. API Testing Skills

Comfortable with using tools like **Postman** or **Bruno** to:
- Send requests to an API
- Provide JSON body and headers
- View responses and validate status codes
- Automate collections for repeated tests

> 💡 For tools, see: [API Testing Tools](./tools.md#api-testing-tools)

---

## 🐞 6. Debugging Experience

The ability to **identify and troubleshoot bugs** during development.

This includes:
- Reading and understanding stack traces
- Using logging tools or breakpoints (e.g., `print`, `console.log`, `logger.debug()`)
- Fixing common backend issues:
  - DB connection errors
  - Invalid input handling
  - Unhandled exceptions

---

✅ **Note**: These skills will ensure a smoother experience throughout the project and allow participants to focus on **designing scalable microservices** rather than struggling with basic development issues.
