With multiple services running, we now use **Docker Compose** to manage them together through a unified configuration.

### 🎯 You’ll Learn:
- Structuring a `docker-compose.yml` file
- Defining services, networks, and volumes
- Scaling services for development/testing
- Making services talk to each other by name

### 🛠 Topics Covered:
- Docker Compose syntax and service definitions
- Declaring DB containers (e.g., Postgres, MySQL)
- Health checks and restart policies
- Local development workflows with Compose
- Mounting source code with `volumes:` for live reloading
