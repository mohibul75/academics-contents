### 🎯 You’ll Learn:
- Why containerization is essential in microservice ecosystems
- How to write Dockerfiles for Python, Node.js, Java, and .NET Core apps
- How to build and run containers
- Container networking and volume mounting

### 🛠 Topics Covered:
- Writing Dockerfiles for each service
- Installing dependencies inside containers
- Exposing ports and configuring environment variables
- Docker CLI basics: `build`, `run`, `exec`, `logs`
- Creating named networks for communication between services
