# üåê Proxies in Distributed Systems

## Overview

In this lecture, we explore the critical role of proxies in distributed systems architecture. Proxies serve as intermediaries that facilitate communication between different components, enabling scalability, security, and efficient resource management.

## Learning Objectives

- Understand the fundamental concepts of proxies in distributed systems
- Differentiate between forward and reverse proxies
- Master the implementation of Nginx as a reverse proxy for microservices
- Apply proxy patterns to solve real-world distributed systems challenges

## Topics Covered

1. **Proxy Fundamentals**
   - Definition and types of proxies
   - Use cases in modern distributed architectures

2. **Reverse Proxies with Nginx**
   - Configuration and implementation
   - Load balancing and routing strategies
   - Security enhancements

## Practical Applications

The concepts covered in this lecture are essential for:
- Microservice architecture implementation
- API gateway design
- Service mesh infrastructure
- Cloud-native application development
