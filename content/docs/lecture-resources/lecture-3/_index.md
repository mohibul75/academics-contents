# Containerization with Docker

## Overview

This lecture introduces Docker, a platform that revolutionizes application development, deployment, and management through containerization technology. Docker enables developers to package applications with all necessary dependencies into standardized units called containers, ensuring consistent behavior across different environments.

### Key Topics

- **Fundamentals of Docker**: Learn what Docker is and how it differs from traditional virtualization technologies
- **Container Architecture**: Understand how Docker leverages Linux kernel features (namespaces and cgroups) to create lightweight, isolated environments
- **Docker Ecosystem**: Explore Docker images, containers, registries, and the Docker Engine
- **Development Workflow**: Learn how to write Dockerfiles, build images, and run containers
- **Practical Applications**: Examine real-world use cases for Docker in development, testing, and production environments

### Learning Objectives

By the end of this lecture, you will be able to:
- Understand the technical foundations of containerization
- Create and manage Docker containers using essential commands
- Write effective Dockerfiles for application packaging
- Implement Docker in your development workflow
- Compare Docker containers with traditional virtual machines

### Why Docker Matters

Docker addresses the classic "it works on my machine" problem by providing a consistent, portable runtime environment. This technology has become fundamental in modern development practices, cloud computing, and DevOps, making it an essential skill for today's software engineers.
