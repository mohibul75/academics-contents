# üåç Distributed Systems Exploration

Distributed systems are the backbone of scalable and fault-tolerant applications. In this phase, we explore **6+ distributed technologies**, understanding **how they work**, **what problems they solve**, and **where they fit in microservices**.

## üîç Exploration Methodology

For this phase, students will work in collaborative teams to deeply investigate distributed systems technologies. Each team will:

1. **Research & Analyze**: Thoroughly explore an assigned distributed system technology
2. **Document Findings**: Create comprehensive technical documentation
3. **Present Solutions**: Deliver an engaging presentation to peers and faculty

Your exploration should focus on these key aspects:

| Focus Area | Key Questions to Address |
|------------|--------------------------|
| üèóÔ∏è **Architecture** | How is the system structured? What are its core components? |
| ‚öôÔ∏è **Working Principles** | What algorithms and techniques make it function? How does data flow? |
| üõ°Ô∏è **High Availability** | How does it handle failures? What redundancy mechanisms exist? |
| üíº **Use Cases** | Where is it most effectively applied? What problems does it solve best? |
| üîÑ **Integration** | How does it fit within a microservices ecosystem? |

Teams will be evaluated on technical depth, presentation quality, and practical insights provided.

## üì¶ 1. **Apache Cassandra** ‚Äì Decentralized NoSQL DB

**Architecture Highlights**:
- Peer-to-peer ring-based system using consistent hashing
- Eventual consistency with tunable quorum reads/writes
- Replication across data centers
- Uses SSTables and Memtables for fast write-heavy workloads

**Use Case**: High-volume write system for analytics or logs.

---

### ‚ö° 2. **Apache Kafka** ‚Äì Distributed Event Streaming Platform

**Architecture Highlights**:
- Distributed commit log with partitioned topics
- Producer ‚Üí Kafka Broker ‚Üí Consumer
- Message durability via segment files on disk
- High-throughput stream processing with horizontal scaling

**Use Case**: Decoupled microservice communication, event sourcing, stream analytics.

---

### üß† 3. **Redis Cluster** ‚Äì In-Memory Key-Value Store (Distributed Mode)

**Architecture Highlights**:
- Hash-slot-based sharding (16,384 slots)
- Master-replica architecture with automatic failover (via Sentinel or Cluster)
- High-speed data access with optional persistence

**Use Case**: Caching for microservices, pub/sub for chat or real-time updates.

---

### üßÆ 4. **Etcd** ‚Äì Distributed Key-Value Store for Configuration & Coordination

**Architecture Highlights**:
- Strongly consistent store using **Raft consensus**
- Frequently used in **Kubernetes** for state/config storage
- Designed for leader election, distributed locking, and configuration management

**Use Case**: Service registry, feature flag storage, cluster coordination.

---

### üîé 5. **Consul** ‚Äì Service Discovery and Key/Value Configuration

**Architecture Highlights**:
- Gossip-based peer discovery
- Offers DNS + HTTP APIs for service registration and health checking
- KV store with ACLs for configuration sharing
- Integrates with Envoy for service mesh features

**Use Case**: Discover microservices dynamically, share config globally across services.

---

### üåê 6. **CockroachDB** ‚Äì Distributed SQL Database

**Architecture Highlights**:
- Follows **Google Spanner-inspired architecture**
- Distributed ACID transactions via Raft
- Multi-region, horizontally scalable SQL
- Strong consistency with PostgreSQL compatibility

**Use Case**: Global backend for services needing relational queries and strong consistency.

---

### üìò 7. **MinIO** ‚Äì Distributed Object Storage (S3-Compatible)

**Architecture Highlights**:
- Distributed erasure-coded storage
- Horizontal scaling with node auto-discovery
- API-compatible with AWS S3
- High-performance object store for cloud-native workloads

**Use Case**: Store file uploads, logs, media in a microservices app without relying on AWS.
