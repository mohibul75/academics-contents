# ðŸ”§ Distributed Systems Lab: A Hands-On Journey into Microservices

Welcome to the **Distributed Systems Lab** â€” the practical segment of the *Distributed Systems* course. This lab is designed not just to explore the theory behind distributed systems, but to dive deep into how they work in practice.

Distributed systems exist in many forms â€” from peer-to-peer networks to large-scale cloud platforms. In this lab, weâ€™ll focus on **microservices**, a popular architectural pattern that supports modularity, scalability, and independent deployment.

Weâ€™ll build and evolve a system from the ground up through a real-world inspired project: **The Smart Library**. Our journey will simulate how modern systems are developed and scaled in stages:

- Start with a **monolithic application** to understand the foundational structure.
- Refactor into **microservices** to improve scalability and flexibility.
- Use tools like **Nginx**, **Docker**, and **Docker Swarm** to manage, deploy, and scale the system.
- Learn essential **system design** concepts along the way.

> By the end of this lab, youâ€™ll not only understand how distributed systems are built, but youâ€™ll have hands-on experience architecting one.


## ðŸŽ¯ Who Is This Lab For?

This lab is ideal for students, early-stage developers, or enthusiasts who want to **learn by building**. If youâ€™re looking to understand the internals of modern backend systems, deployment practices, and scalable design patterns â€” this is the place to start.

By the end of this lab, youâ€™ll have:
- Built and deployed a real microservice project
- Understood how containers and proxies tie into distributed systems
- Practiced core DevOps concepts with tools like Docker and Nginx
- Learned how to design for scale, performance, and reliability

Letâ€™s get building! ðŸš€
