# ðŸ”§ Distributed Systems Lab: A Hands-On Journey into Microservices

Welcome to the **Distributed Systems Lab** â€” the practical segment of the *Distributed Systems* course. This lab is designed not just to explore the theory behind distributed systems, but to dive deep into how they work in practice.

Distributed systems exist in many forms â€” from peer-to-peer networks to large-scale cloud platforms. In this lab, weâ€™ll focus on **microservices**, a popular architectural pattern that supports modularity, scalability, and independent deployment.

Weâ€™ll build and evolve a system from the ground up through a real-world inspired project: **The Smart Library**. Our journey will simulate how modern systems are developed and scaled in stages:

- Start with a **monolithic application** to understand the foundational structure.
- Refactor into **microservices** to improve scalability and flexibility.
- Use tools like **Nginx**, **Docker**, and **Docker Swarm** to manage, deploy, and scale the system.
- Learn essential **system design** concepts along the way.

> By the end of this lab, youâ€™ll not only understand how distributed systems are built, but youâ€™ll have hands-on experience architecting one.


## ðŸŽ“ Who Is This Lab For?

This Lab is designed for anyone interested in exploring distributed systems concepts through hands-on practice. It provides a practical approach to understanding how distributed systems work in real-world environments.

ðŸŒ± This lab is perfect for:
- Technology enthusiasts eager to apply theoretical concepts in real-world scenarios
- Early-career developers looking to strengthen their backend skills
- Tech professionals passionate about modern system architecture
- Anyone who believes in **learning by building** practical projects

If you're curious about how modern tech giants architect their systems, how cloud-native applications function, or how to design resilient distributed servicesâ€”this lab will provide hands-on experience with industry-relevant tools and practices.

### ðŸš€ What You'll Accomplish

By completing this lab journey, you'll:
- Design and deploy a complete microservice-based project
- Master container orchestration with Docker and related technologies
- Implement service discovery and load balancing with Nginx
- Apply fault tolerance and resilience patterns in distributed environments
- Gain practical DevOps experience through CI/CD implementation
- Develop a portfolio-worthy project demonstrating real-world skills

Let's transform theoretical knowledge into practical expertise! ðŸ’»âœ¨
