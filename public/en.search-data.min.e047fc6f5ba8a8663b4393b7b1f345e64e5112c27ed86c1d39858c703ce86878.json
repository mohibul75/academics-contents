This system is ideal for simple deployments where all components are tightly coupled, sharing the same runtime and database.\n🧩 Functional Modules # 1. User Management Module # Register a user (students/faculty). Update user profile. Retrieve user info. 2. Book Management Module # Add/update/remove books. View book availability. Search books by title, author, or genre. 3. Loan Management Module # Issue books to users. Return books. View active/past loans. 🛢️ Unified Database Schema # Table Description users Stores user information. books Stores book catalog details. loans Tracks issued/returned books. All modules interact with this shared relational database, typically PostgreSQL or MySQL.\n🔄 Internal Communication # All module calls happen via function calls or internal classes. Tight coupling between modules. No network-based interaction — all components reside in the same codebase and memory space. 🧪 Example API Documentation (REST Endpoints) # Here’s how external clients (like CLI tools or a potential frontend) interact with the system.\n🔹 User Endpoints # POST /api/users # Create/register a new user.\n{ \u0026#34;name\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Alice Smith\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;email\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;alice@example.com\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;role\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;student\u0026#34; } GET /api/users/{id} # Fetch user profile by ID.\n🔹 Book Endpoints # POST /api/books # Add a new book.\n{ \u0026#34;title\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Clean Code\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;author\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Robert C.

Tight coupling makes it difficult to change or test modules in isolation. Single point of failure: one bug can crash the entire app. Deployment of small changes requires redeploying the whole system.
